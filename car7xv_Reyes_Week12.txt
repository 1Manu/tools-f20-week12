1. What I have enjoyed about this class is learning real world things that aren't generally taught in classes and can be used to create independent things and impress employers. I also really enjoy having such a friendly and talented staff that aren't hard to talk to and don't overcomplicate things.
2. I would incorporate some way for people in the class to meet eachother other than connecting with each other on LinkedIn. I really liked all of the content of the class, but wish there was a little bit more networking.
3. The most important thing is learning the content, there is no real stress about getting everything right on the assignment. If you really learn the content, you're going to pass the assignment. Also, take advantage of office hours even though this is just a one credit class the staff is very experienced and can help with anything.
