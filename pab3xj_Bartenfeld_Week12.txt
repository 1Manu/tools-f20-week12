1) what you've enjoyed about this course

- I enjoyed exploring new technologies/tools and strategies that I
  ordinarily would not have experienced or seen on my own.

2) what you would change about this course

- I would firstly make sure that when covering anything in the instructions
  in videos and in written descriptions that it applies to both Windows and MacOS.
  I had a few frustrating moments of having to translate MacOS commands into Windows commands.

3) any advice you have for next semester's students

- Don't stress yourself out but also make sure you're learning something new and
  not just going through the motions for each activity.
