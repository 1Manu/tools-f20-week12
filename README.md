# CS 1501: IToT - Week 12: GitHub Collaboration

In most (if not all) software development jobs, you'll use GitHub to collaborate and save your code! So far, we've used GitHub to host a webpage with just our own files. In the industry, you'll be collaborating with different software engineers and doing things like *branching* your code or creating a *pull request.* That's what we'll be going over this week!

This week's assignment will be to **submit a pull request to this repo**. More specifically, you'll have to **fork** this repo, **create a branch** to edit, **merge** to your own main branch of your forked repo, and **submit a pull request** to this repo.
This change specifically will be you adding a .txt file to this repo in the file format name *ComputingID_LastName_Week12.txt*. 
In this text file, you'll have to discuss: 
1. what you've enjoyed about this course
2. what you would change about this course 
3. any advice you have for next semester's students
Please take time for these questions as this class is constantly changing based off of your experience.

In the past weeks, we've given you video tutorials, but now that we're towards the end, we want to make sure you get into the habit of researching already-existing documentation and comprehending it. To help supplement this, we'll be hosting more OH this week.

* [Here](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/) is a great resource to learn how to create a pull request from a forked repository.
* [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) is a great resource actually written by GitHub about how to create a branch.
