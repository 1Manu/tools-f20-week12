# CS 1501: IToT - Week 12: GitHub Collaboration

In most (if not all) software development jobs, you'll use GitHub to collaborate and save your code! So far, we've used GitHub to host a webpage with just our own files. In the industry, you'll be collaborating with different software engineers and doing things like *branching* your code or creating a *pull request.* That's what we'll be going over this week!

This week's assignment will be to **submit a pull request to this repo**. More specifically, you'll have to **fork** this repo, **create a new branch**, **add a .txt file** to your newly created branch, and **submit a pull request** to this repo.
This change specifically will be you adding a .txt file to this repo in the file format name *ComputingID_LastName_Week12.txt*. 
In this text file, you'll have to discuss: 
1. what you've enjoyed about this course
2. what you would change about this course 
3. any advice you have for next semester's students

Please take time for these questions as this class is constantly changing based off of your experience.

In the past weeks, we've given you video tutorials, but now that we're towards the end, we want to make sure you get into the habit of researching already-existing documentation and comprehending it. To help supplement this, we'll be hosting more OH this week.

* [Here](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/) is a great resource to learn how to create a pull request from a forked repository. You can ignore Step 3 and then replace Step 4 with Step 3 in our *Step by Step*.
* [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) is a great resource actually written by GitHub about how to create a branch.

### Step by Step
1. **[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository**. Forking a repository allows you to create a copy of an already existing repository and experiment without changing the original repository. This is great if you find a project online that you'd personally like to explore without worrying about permanent change. This is also great if you'd like to [contribute to an open-source project](https://opensource.guide) (this project is similar to contributing to open source). You can do this simply by clicking the button on the top right of the screen next to Watch and Star.
2. **[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository** onto your computer to have a *local* copy.
3. **[Create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)**. Once you have your repository open locally, this can be done by going into your Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) and giving the command `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. For your branch name, please put *add-computingID-txt*. Please continue all other steps on this branch.
4. **Add a .txt file**. Follow the instructions above for the file contents. Here, you'll create a .txt file. For Windows, you can do this in [Notepad](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001359.htm). For Mac, you can do this on [TextEdit](https://macreports.com/how-to-create-a-text-txt-file-on-a-mac/). These are pre-installed softwares and should be the least technically challenging portion of this assignment. If you have problems with this portion or any other, please post in Discord #content-questions or come to office hours!
4. **Submit a pull request**. After you add, commit, and push, come back to this *original* repository and click the **Pull requests** tab. There you'll see a prompt in a yellow box and button that says *Compare & Pull Request*. For a more detailed view, scroll down to [Step 7](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/).

### Additional Logistic Information
This assignment will be graded hand-in-hand with Collab's Week 12 LinkedIn assignment. If you complete one half, but not the other, you'll be given an Unsatisfactory and therefore a Fail. Please avoid procrasination and keep in mind all PRs are time-stamped and we can see your history.

Madi Flynn will also be hosting a specifically Git-based OH this week where you can ask questions that you may have not gotten answered the first time around. If you can't attend this session, feel free to post these questions in #content-questions and she'll post the recording (if it can't be answered via text) after the session.
