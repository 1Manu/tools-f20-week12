1) What you've enjoyed about this course
	I personally enjoyed getting to learn new features and programs in my desired field. Using programs like VS Code and Git Bash was super neat to learn about. 
2) What you would change about this course
	I was hoping there was a way to take material I learned in the first few lessons and have to use it for the next. I realize that we learned about different techniques but it seemed sometimes like ping pong going from one lesson to another which was completely unrelated. Maybe having a way to make the class flow with all the material so builds on itself almost.
3) Any advice you have for next semester's students
	I would say that the biggest piece of advice I could give for new students would be to constantly talk to the TA's. Towards the end of the class they really helped me with some lessons that I couldn't get on my own. Another thing too is to either take the class with a friend or to pair up with someone from the start. On a few assignments I found that collaboration worked well because of being able to talk thigs out to someone else.
