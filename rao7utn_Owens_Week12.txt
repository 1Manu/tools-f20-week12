1. What you've enjoyed about this course
	I have enjoyed that the class gives you a wide breath of technology to be introduced to
2. What you would change about this course
	Maybe more work with git and github? make assignments due through github and make the class feel more like contributing to an open source project.
3. Any advice you have for next semester's students
	Remeber to do the proffessional development google form. I forgot it existed until I re-read the syllbus yesterday
