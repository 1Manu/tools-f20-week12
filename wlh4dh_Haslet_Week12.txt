What I enjoyed about this course:

My favorite part of the cousre was being introduced to the many pieces of software and tools that 
are used by professionals in the industry. I think one of the most important parts of what I did 
in the course was working on my resume and LinkedIn page, which I probably wouldn't have put as 
much effort into otherwise. All of the career focused parts of the course were very benefical.

What I would change about this course:

It would be nice to go more in-depth with many of the tools we learned about, but it makes more
since to have the students do that on their own becuase of time constraints.

Advice for next semester's students:

Spend more time with all the tools that the course teaches about and try to inegrate them with
any personal projects or classwork. Repetition and exposure are some of the best ways to learn,
at least for me.
