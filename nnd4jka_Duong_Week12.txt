1) what you've enjoyed about this course

- I think this course has been very helpful as it helps us build basic foundational knowledge coming into Computer Science. I also enjoy the enthusiasm of the TA when helping the students.

2) what you would change about this course

- As the first time holding the course, I think it has been going great. I would say something to change is to have clearer instructions as some of us have different laptops so we often have to spend a lot of time to figure out the correct way (Ex: when I have a window and I struggled a bit when we did Unix command line)

3) any advice you have for next semester's students

- I would say that going to the TA is very helpful. If you have any problems with your laptop or in the process of doing the activity, Piazza is very great too. So, utilize all the resources that you have.
