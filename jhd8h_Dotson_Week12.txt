1. I enjoyed being able to touch on a number of topics, even if some of the content was covered in other classes that I have taken (the testing week in specific). 

2. I would personally like a bit more depth on the practical topics, perhaps dealing with git conflicts, or a bit more with Bash.

3. For next semester's students, I would recommend doing assignments early, and staying up to date with the piazza/wherever the staff post updates on the course content.
