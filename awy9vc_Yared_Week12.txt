1. I've enjoyed the real-life applications of this course and I feel like I have learned a great deal of useful information.

2. I would not change anything about this course. I think it was very beneficial and had a very manageable workload.

3. The only advice I have for next semester's students is to pay attention, take good notes, and to do every weekly assignment as they are all helpful.
